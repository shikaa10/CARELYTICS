📊 Healthcare Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to evaluate patient wait times, satisfaction scores, and visit trends. By exploring both clinical and administrative factors, the analysis aims to uncover patterns in system efficiency and highlight areas for data-driven improvements in healthcare delivery.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze patient wait times to assess service efficiency.

Compare satisfaction scores across appointment types.

Study monthly visit trends to identify seasonal or recurring patterns.

Explore the dynamics of administrative vs. non-administrative appointments, referrals, and walk-ins.

Provide insights into demographic distributions (age, race, etc.) and their impact on patient experience.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes patient appointment details such as:

Appointment type (administrative, non-administrative, referral, walk-in)

Patient demographics (age, race)

Wait times and satisfaction scores

Visit dates (for monthly trend analysis)

(You can update this section with the actual dataset name/source once finalized.)

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI for dashboarding.

📊 Key Insights

Patterns in patient wait times reveal efficiency gaps.

Differences between administrative vs. non-administrative appointments highlight bottlenecks.

Walk-in dynamics significantly influence patient flow and satisfaction.

Monthly visit trends uncover peaks and lows in healthcare demand.

Demographic analysis shows disparities across age and race groups, guiding equity-focused improvements.

🚀 Outcomes

Clear visualizations of wait times, trends, and demographics.

Insights for hospital administrators to reduce wait times and improve satisfaction.

Recommendations for resource allocation and scheduling strategies.

📌 Future Scope

Apply predictive analytics to forecast patient wait times.

Use clustering to segment patients by appointment patterns.

Integrate machine learning models to predict satisfaction based on service features.
